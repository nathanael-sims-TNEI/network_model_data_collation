# Network Model Data Collation

This project integrates data from the TEC Register, Interconnector Register, ETYS AppB, and Substation Coordinates files, along with predefined mapping files that link TEC & IC Register Project Numbers to ETYS Substation names. The result is a structured workbook containing all necessary data to facilitate the construction of a power system model of the GB transmission network.
